= Strelka Ideas

This is in-progress documentation for stuff that doesn't yet work, but is
planned for a future release.

Everything here is subject to change, but we'll try to keep this document
up-to-date if it does.

== Leash

=== Setting Up A Mongrel2 Cluster

Leash also comes with subcommands for interacting with Mongrel2. You can start
a new cluster using the 'setup' subcommand:

	server1$ leash setup 
	Creating bootstrap config...
	Starting mongrel2...
	Starting up control app...
	Okay, point a browser at http://localhost:37772/

At this point, you can either use further leash commands, or use the web
interface:

    server1$ open http://localhost:37772/


=== Adding Strelka to an Existing Mongrel2 Instance

If you already have an existing Mongrel2 environment, leash can also add 
itself alongside it:

    server1$ leash setup existing.sqlite
    Adding Strelka to existing config...
    Starting mongrel2...
    Start up control app...
	Okay, point a browser at http://localhost:37772/

The admin app will then let you examine and edit the configuration for your
existing mongrel2 server, just as you would with a new server.


=== Join a Mongrel2 Cluster

Once you have the first node set up, you need only point 'leash' to the admin
server running on the first host to set up and automatically configure
additional Mongrel2 front-ends:

	server2$ leash join server1

This uses a 0MQ service running from the admin server that publishes the
config using Mongrel2's "config from anything" protocol, so when Mongrel2
itself supports the 'zmq.so' plugin, you won't even need a local SQLite
database.


== Strelka Applications

* Apps have an appid constant (the mongrel2 UUID)
* Apps are distributed in gems
* A larger app can be split across multiple applets within a gem
  - The gem can suggest a set of routes
  - The Strelka admin interface can display the gem with its suggested routes
* The framework provides convenience methods for looking up the route to
  another app via its appid.

For example, a CMS called "Snipper" might come in a gem called 'snipper'
