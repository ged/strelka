= Strelka Ideas

This is in-progress documentation for stuff that doesn't yet work, but is
planned for a future release.

Everything here is subject to change, but we'll try to keep this document
up-to-date if it does.

== Leash

Show a list of installed applications:

    $ leash discover
    Searching for Strelka applications...
    
    strelka:
    hello-world
    
    strelka-admin:
    config-service  strelka-admin   strelka-setup
	
	strelka-cms:
	content-manager

Set up an application's runtime directory and add a route for it to an existing
mongrel2 config database:

    $ mkdir /service/cms
	$ cd /service/cms
    $ leash -c /usr/local/etc/mongrel2.sqlite setup strelka-cms content-manager

The application can register pre- and post-install hooks that run migrations,
prompt for config values, etc.

Then, to start the app:

    $ cd /service/cms
    $ leash --sudo start

This stuff will probably use Isolate[https://github.com/jbarnette/isolate] for
gem sandboxing.


== Strelka Applications

* The framework provides convenience methods for looking up the route to
  another app via its appid.



=== Future Plugins

* CORS (cors) â€” manage {Cross-Origin Resource Sharing}[http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/]
  headers
* caching -- utilities for easy HTTP caching
