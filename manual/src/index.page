Strelka is a framework for creating and deploying "Mongrel2":http://mongrel2.org/ web applications in Ruby, and for managing a Mongrel2 cluster.

It's named after a lesser known "Russian cosmonaut":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strelka_(dog)#Belka_and_Strelka who was one of the first canine space travelers to orbit the Earth and return alive.  Her name means "little arrow".

The first part of this manual, <?link Getting Started ?>, is a step-by-step tutorial on setting up a bare minimum Strelka app.

The <?link "tutorial":Strelka Tutorial ?> section builds off of the minimal application, covering the Strelka plugins, along with providing some general tips and tricks.  Most of the heavy lifting is already done for you in Strelka plugins -- this is where the good stuff is when writing a new application!

Want to package your app as a gem for distribution and deployment?  There's a section called <?link Deploying a Strelka App ?> that covers that.

Then we dive in a little deeper, and show you how you can <?link Write Your Own Strelka Plugin ?> by refactoring common code out of your applications, and hooking into the friendly underbelly of Strelka.  It's okay, Strelka likes her belly rubbed.
