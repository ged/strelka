Strelka is a framework for creating and deploying "Mongrel2":http://mongrel2.org/ web applications in Ruby, and for managing a Mongrel2 cluster.

It's named after the Russian dog who was one of the first space travelers to orbit the Earth and return alive.

The first part of this manual, <?link Writing a Strelka App ?>, is a step-by-step tutorial on setting up a new Strelka app.

Then there's a section called <?link Deploying a Strelka App ?> that covers packaging up your app as a gem and deploying it.

Then we dive in a little deeper, and show you how you can <?link Write Your Own Strelka Plugin ?> by refactoring common code out of your applications.

Finally, there's a <?link "cookbook":Strelka Cookbook ?>-style section that covers general tips and tricks.
