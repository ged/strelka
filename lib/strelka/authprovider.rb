# This is the abstract base class for authentication and/or authorization providers
# for the {:auth plugin}[Strelka::App::Auth].
#
# To define your own authentication provider, you'll need to inherit this class (either
# directly or via a subclass), name it <tt>Strelka::AuthProvider::{Something}</tt>,
# save it in a file named <tt>strelka/authprovider/{something}.rb</tt>, and
# override the required methods.
#
# Which methods you'll need to provide implementations for depends on whether
# your provider provides *authentication*, *authorization*, or both.
#
# == Authentication Providers
#
# Authentication providers should override either one or both of the following methods,
# depending on whether they will provide authentication, authorization, or both:
#
# * #authenticate
# * #authorize
