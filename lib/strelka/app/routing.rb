# Sinatra-ish routing logic for Strelka::Apps
#
# This plugin adds the ability to declare hooks for requests based on their
# attributes. The default router (Strelka::Router::Default) uses only the
# HTTP verb and the path, but you can also define your own router class if
# you want to include other attributes.
#
# You declare a hook using the HTTP verb, followed by the path, followed by
# a Hash of options and a block that will be called when a matching request
# is handled.
#
# When two or more hooks match the same request, the most-specific match
# wins. The mongrel2 route part of the path is stripped before comparing.
#
# The hooks are given a Strelka::Request object, and are expected to
# return either a Strelka::Response or something that can be made
# into one.
#
# == Examples
#
#   class HelloWorld < Strelka::App
#
#       plugins :routing
#
#       # match any GET request
#       get do |req|
#           return req.response << 'Hello, World!'
#       end
#
#       # match any GET request whose path starts with '/goodbye'
#       get '/goodbye' do |req|
#           return req.response << "Goodbye, cruel World!"
#       end
#
#
#   end # class HelloWorld
#
# == Routing Strategies
#
# The algorithm used to map requests to routes are defined by an object
# that implements the Strategy pattern. These routing strategies are pluggable,
# so if Mongrel2's the "longest-match wins" routing isn't to your taste,
# you can specify a different one using the +router+ declaration. Strelka
# comes with one alternative "exclusive" router that implements a more
# restrictive mapping:
#
#   class ExclusiveHelloWorld < Strelka::App
#
#       plugins :routing
#       router :exclusive
#
#       # match a GET request for the exact route only
#       get do |req|
#           return req.response << 'Hello, World!'
#       end
#
#       # only match a GET request for '/goodbye'
#       get '/goodbye' do |req|
#           return req.response << "Goodbye, cruel World!"
#       end
#
#      # Every other request responds with a 404
#
#   end # class ExclusiveHelloWorld
#
# == Custom Routers
#
# See the Strelka::Router for information on how to define your own
# routing strategies.
