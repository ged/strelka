= Стрелке (Strelka)

* http://deveiate.org/projects/Strelka

== Description

Strelka is a framework for creating and deploying Mongrel2 web applications
in Ruby. It's still pretty new.

It's named after the Russian dog who was one of the first space travelers
to orbit the Earth and return alive.


== Prerequisites

* Mongrel2 [http://mongrel2.org/]
* Ruby 1.9.2 or better


== Installation

    $ gem install strelka


== Usage

Strelka consists of two parts: a runtime environment that you can use to set
up a Mongrel2 cluster, and an application framework for developing Mongrel2
applications. 


=== The Runtime Environment

The Strelka runtime environment provides a convenient way to set up a Mongrel2
server, configure it, install Ruby applications that talk to it, and then
replicate that configuration and application setup over multiple front-end and
back-end servers (if you want).

You aren't required to use it, of course, but the documentation may assume
that you are at some points.

If you'd rather just use the application-framework part by itself, skip on
down to the 'The Application Framework' section.

=== Leash

Strelka comes with a command-line tool called 'leash' that you can use to
bootstrap the Strelka runtime environment. 

Make a directory for the server to run in, then run 'setup':

    $ mkdir strelka
    $ leash setup
	Loading config from [...]/strelka-0.0.1pre9/data/strelka/bootstrap-config.rb
	W, [2011-09-27T17:06:20.093620 #26013]  WARN -- : Installing config schema.
	Setting up chroot environment...
	  copying static assets...
	  creating directories...
	Starting mongrel2...
	Starting up control app...
	Okay, point a browser at http://localhost:7337/

This will start mongrel2 and the Strelka admin application, and from there,
you can use a browser for mostly everything else.

[to be continued]


=== The Application Framework

The application framework is primarily geared towards developing web
applications at the moment, but the intention is to make Strelka useful for
developing applications that use the other protocols supported by Mongrel2
at some point as well.

The framework is centered around the Strelka::App class, which is the class
you'll subclass when creating your own applications. It doesn't do much by
default; you can decide what facilities you'll need and add them to your
application via a plugin system.

=== Standard Plugins

 - routing::
 - parameters::
 - filters::
 - templating::


=== Writing Your Own Plugins
